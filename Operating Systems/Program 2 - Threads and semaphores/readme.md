Write a C/C++ program to implement the Dining Philosophers algorithm. This implementation must use Pthreads and either semaphores or mutexes. 
Have the main thread terminate the philosopher threads after five minutes. The operations of eat and think are to be millisecond sleeps of random duration (25 to 49 milliseconds each). 
Collect statistics for how many times and how much time each philospher performed eat or think activities.
