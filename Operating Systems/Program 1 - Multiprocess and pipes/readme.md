Write a multiprocess, C/C++ program which uses getdomainname, gethostname, and uname to get and display system information about machine. 
Furthermore, this application is to use pipes to communicate a nine-digit, text formatted value from the client to the server. 
The server is then required to verify whether or not the sequence supplied represents a magic square and provide a T/F response. 
The multiprocess application may be written either as two separate mains or created using the fork() system call. 
A threaded application is unacceptable and will result in a grade of zero.
